# Contact Form UI

This is a simple **Contact Page** project made with just **HTML and CSS**.  
I created it to practice clean UI design and responsiveness. The page has a contact form and some cards to show details. It works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.


##  Whatâ€™s inside?
- A clean contact form with styled input fields  
- Contact info cards with hover effects  
- Fully responsive layout (by using media queries)  
- Minimal and modern look  


##  Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3  


## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
index2.html # Main HTML file
styles.css # Stylesheet
README.md # Documentation



##  Responsive Design
- On big screens: Form and cards appear side by side  
- On tablets: Cards resize and fit neatly  
- On small screens (mobiles): Everything stacks vertically for easy reading
